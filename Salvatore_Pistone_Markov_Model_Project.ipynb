A large part of the problem potentially occurs in the fact that once a user is lost they never return. This model not allowing users to return if they decide not to renew means that in all likelyhood users will not continue to use the service long term. This service also does not incentivize the basic option since the data does not explicitly express that any of the 100 users in the sample ever decided to upgrade, however it does specificy that users did downgrade. It would be reasonable to assume that some users who liked the service would attempt to upgrade to a more premium version. Not allowing users the ability to gain access to more features unless they do directly from the free trial is a poor way to retain users and may likely be the main reason that the model predicts very confidently that 100% of basic users will be lost, rather then the small possibility that the unlimited option may retain a very small amount."

However, this is still a significant improvment since this is nearly a 20% increase in the amount of active users then previously. These are also conservative observations as it makes the assumption that 50 percent of users will be lost and lost forever despite being able to return to either the basic plan or unlimited plan. It can even be assumed that because the new changes involve being able to upgrade from the basic option to the unlimited that more people may return to the basic state, which can lead to more people in the unlimited state and ultimately lead to more retention.
